# Possible Path Finder (ppf)

This project is based on this scenario: Assume that a traveler t plans to visit
some cities in a network. As seen in the figure, there is one-way
transportation between any of two cities (i.e., this is a directed graph where directions are
represented by arrows). Starting from a city, say x, t can visit only the cities whose maximum
distance from x is three. For example, if t starts from ‘C’ then the list of cities that are
reachable is {‘E’, ‘G’, ‘H’, ‘A’, ‘K’, ‘N’,‘O’}.
